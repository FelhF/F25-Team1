## About me: I am not sure what to say, so I will just mention a few hobbies of mine. I like to read and draw, along with play videogames and listen to music.

## Goals: I want to get better at using github. From what I have seen, github is very commonly used in software development. The better I get at and understanding github and its features, the better.
