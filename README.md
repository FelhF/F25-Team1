Deal finder is a website designed to allow users to find deals and discounts currently available at online stores or local retailers. Customers can check local deals or join bulletin boards about specific topics for deal announcements of those specific topics. Users can also notify bulletin board creators about deals or review bulletin board based on their accuracy, update speed, or quality/reliability of deals listed.

Users can create bulletin boards to notify about deals. Bulletin board creators can update the list of deals currently displayed to their bulletin board to keep it up to date with the latest deals and discounts. Creators can also respond to reviews or flag them for admin moderation. Creators can view the percentage of users who were redirected to the deal's website.

Many online stores and local stores do not advertise current deals that are being offered. If someone is interested in a particular item, they must visit multiple different websites and hope that they are on sale or discounted. 
This website was created for users interested in a specific topic or item to be notified of deals in a single website, without having to visit each website individually. Some online stores also keep track of what users are interested in and may modify the prices of said items based on their history. This website reduces the information tracked by those online stores to reduce price manipulation.
